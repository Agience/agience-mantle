"""
Bootstrap constants — platform-known-at-init slugs, content types, and list fixtures.

OS analogy: These are the filesystem formats and mount points the platform must
understand to boot.  The platform knows these constants at init time so it can
create the initial platform collections and singleton artifacts during startup.

No other Core code should reference content type strings or slug strings directly —
all runtime type resolution flows through the type registry (types_service) and
the ID registry (platform_topology).

Consumed by the declarative seed loader (`seed_provisioning.loader` /
`seed_provisioning.user_provisioning`) and `platform_topology` — slugs map seed
artifacts to their stable UUIDs and drive per-user grant/materialization.

Do NOT add new entries here unless the constant is required for platform bootstrap.
Content types that are not created at startup belong to their owning MCP server.
