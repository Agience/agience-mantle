"""MantleUnifiedAccessor — RRF fusion of MANTLE vector + SSE lexical (Step 2.6.8).

The canonical search backend after OpenSearch retirement (Step 2.6.9
part 2, 2026-05-09). The two arms are:

- :class:`SseQueryEngine` — encrypted lexical (replaces OpenSearch BM25).
- :class:`MantleQueryEngine` — encrypted vector (unchanged).

Fusion uses standard Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60 default, matching the
existing accessor). Hits are at *artifact* granularity: MANTLE chunk hits
collapse to artifact level (best chunk score wins) before fusion, and
SSE entries are already at artifact level. The fused result is a list of
ranked ``UnifiedHit`` records that carry the underlying scores, a
provenance flag (``"sse"`` / ``"vector"`` / ``"both"``), and the owner /
collection context for downstream metadata hydration.

Because neither SSE nor MANTLE stores plaintext text (encryption-at-rest
is the whole point), the unified accessor does *not* hydrate
title/description/content here. The consumer (the search router in
2.6.9) reads those from Arango by ``artifact_id`` after fusion, the same
way it'd read any artifact's metadata. Keeping hydration outside the
accessor keeps the fusion logic pure and testable without an Arango
fixture.
