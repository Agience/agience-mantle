"""LightConeResolver — BFS over `collection_artifacts` origin edges.

Resolves the set of artifact IDs reachable from a principal's grants by
walking ``origin: true, relationship: null`` edges outbound through
Arango, intersecting each edge's ``propagate`` mask with the requested
action.

CRUDEASIO lives in Mantle (Arango grants collection). Grants are read
directly from `db_arango.get_active_grants_for_grantee` — no Origin HTTP
calls. This keeps the resolver on the same data source as `check_access`.

After OpenSearch retirement (Step 2.6.9), this is the only ACL path —
both MANTLE-SSE lexical and MANTLE vector search consume the resolver's
authorized artifact set. The legacy flat ACL filter that lived in the
OpenSearch query builder is gone.

See `.dev/features/mantle-mvp.md` § Layer 1.
