"""Unified /events WebSocket — Phase 2, Enterprise Eventing refactor.

Single bidirectional channel for all real-time artifact and operation events.
Clients can hold multiple subscriptions on one connection, each with its own
server-side filter.

## Protocol

### Client → Server (JSON messages)

```
{"op": "subscribe",   "id": "<client-sub-id>", "filter": {...}}
{"op": "unsubscribe", "id": "<client-sub-id>"}
{"op": "ping"}
```

Filter shape (all fields optional; empty filter matches every event the
caller is authorized to see):

```
{
  "container_id": "workspace-or-collection-id",
  "artifact_id":  "artifact-id",
  "content_type": "application/vnd.agience.operator+json",
  "event_names":  ["artifact.invoke.*", "artifact.created"]
}
```

### Server → Client (JSON messages)

```
{"ack": "<client-sub-id>"}                      # subscription confirmed
{"unack": "<client-sub-id>"}                    # unsubscription confirmed
{"pong": true}
{"event": "<name>", "payload": {...}, "sub_id": "<client-sub-id>", "ts": 1712345678.9, "event_id": "abc"}
```

### Auth

Bearer token in the `Authorization` header (same pattern as the rest of mantle).
Browser clients that cannot set WS headers may pass `?access_token=...` as a
query parameter.

### ACL

Each delivery is filtered server-side by the authenticated user's grants.
Events whose `container_id` / `artifact_id` the caller cannot `read` are
silently dropped. (Grant-scoped filtering uses the existing
`_check_grant_permission` helper.)

This endpoint is the only real-time event surface on the platform. The
legacy per-container SSE stream (`/artifacts/{container_id}/events`) has
been removed; all clients subscribe through `/events`.
